 * <p>
 * Steps:
 * <p>
 * PREDICT X'
 * <p>
 * First, we predict our next x:
 * <p>
 * x' = Fx + u
 * <p>
 * UPDATE P'
 * <p>
 * We also update the covariance matrix according to the next prediction:
 * <p>
 * P' = FP(transp F)
 * <p>
 * UPDATE Y
 * <p>
 * y becomes the difference between the move and what we expected:
 * <p>
 * y = z - Hx
 * <p>
 * UPDATE S
 * <p>
 * S is the covariance of the move, adding up the covariance in move space of the position and the covariance of the measurement:
 * <p>
 * S = HP(transp H) + R
 * <p>
 * CALCULATE K
 * <p>
 * Now I start to wave my hands. I assume this next matrix is called K because this is the work of the Kalman filter. Whatever is happening here, it doesn't depend on u or z. We're computing how much of the difference between the observed move and the expected move to add to x.
 * <p>
 * K = P (transp H) (inv S)
 * <p>
 * UPDATE X'
 * <p>
 * We update x:
 * <p>
 * x' = x + Ky
 * <p>
 * SUBTRACT P
 * <p>
 * And we subtract some uncertainty from P, again not depending on u or z:
 * <p>
 * P' = P - P(transp H)(inv S)HP
